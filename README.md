An interactive web application that transforms how students learn by turning disconnected notes into **visual concept maps**. The platform helps learners organize knowledge, build meaningful connections, and collaborate in real-time.

---

Project Overview
Traditional learning is often **linear and disconnected**. This project introduces a **node-based visual mapping tool** where students can:
- Create and organize concept nodes with drag-and-drop.
- Connect related ideas through dynamic linking.
- Embed rich content (text, links, images, multimedia).
- Share maps as PDFs for group learning and collaboration.

---
 Core Features
- **Interactive Node Creation** – Customize nodes with colors, sizes, and categories.  
- **Dynamic Linking System** – Show relationships and dependencies between concepts.  
- **Rich Content Embedding** – Add notes, external links, and multimedia for deeper learning.  
- **Collaborative Sharing** – Real-time editing with peers + export to PDF.  

---

Technical Architecture
- **Frontend:** React.js with D3.js / Vis.js for interactive graph visualization.  
- **Backend:** Node.js for data management and PDF export.  
- **Collaboration:** WebSockets for real-time updates.

 Development Roadmap
1. **Phase 1:** Core functionality (nodes, links, basic graph visualization).  
2. **Phase 2:** Rich content, advanced styling, import/export, user authentication.  
3. **Phase 3:** Real-time collaboration, commenting, version control.  
4. **Phase 4:** Advanced analytics (learning insights, gap analysis, recommendations).  

---

 Use Cases
- **Students:** Organize study notes into connected knowledge maps.  
- **Teachers:** Build interactive lesson maps and share with learners.  
- **Teams:** Collaborate on brainstorming, research, and project planning.

 Vision
To revolutionize learning by making it **visual, interactive, and collaborative**, helping students truly understand the **connections between ideas** rather than memorizing isolated facts.
